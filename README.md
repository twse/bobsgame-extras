# Extra stuff for bob's game
This repository contains all the extra stuff created for use in bob's game excluding fonts (see bobsgame-fonts repository).

## Google search form
The Bob Corporation website does not have a Google search form. This form requires an active connection to the internet.

## Icons
Icons using the lowercase letters of [bob's game font](http://www.bobcorporation.com/fonts/bobsgame.ttf) for OS/2 programs. Use them to replace icons from the program resources. See Third-Party Notices.md for commercial and unsupported freeware credits.

## Art Department
Want to be a show-off? Impress your friends? This is the place. Robert Pelloni offers a few wallpapers for you. In any case, please feel free to download these and use them on your desktop.

## Nintendo 3DS Skin
Use Anemone or Themely to replace the skin. The skin was created with 3DS Theme Editor.

## Windows OEM Branding
The zipped archive is included for use with Windows 95 until XP.

Under Windows Vista and newer, you have to add the Logo with the value as OEMlogo.bmp and Manufacturer with the value of Robert Matthew Pelloni in OEMInformation under the HKLM key.

## Boot Skin
The actual logo is in BootSkin Windows XP format. Attempting to install this logo under Windows Vista will most likely result in an error message, so please don't try it. I created this with Windows Paint.

Use the Windows XP version of [BootSkin](https://www.stardock.com/products/bootskin) to replace the boot skin.

## Palm OS Emulator Skin
Use this to replace the Generic skin from the executable file (bmp) or simply access them from the Skins dialog (jpg). The skin is assigned to some Palm devices. The jpg files were created with PMView.

This skin can be used with the emulators listed below. Robert Pelloni is not the original author of these emulators.
