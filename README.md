# Extra stuff for bob's game
Contains extra stuff for bob's game except fonts.

## Google search form (requires internet connection)
There's no Google search form in the [Bob Corporation website](http://www.bobcorporation.com/). Includes an option to search the wiki hosted by FANDOM.

## Icons (All icons in OS/2 format)
Icons based on the lowercase letters of [bob's game font](http://www.bobcorporation.com/fonts/bobsgame.ttf) for use with OS/2 programs. Use them to replace icons from the program resources. See **Third-Party Notices.md** for commercial and unsupported freeware credits.

## Art Department
Want to be a show-off? Impress your friends? This is the place. Robert Pelloni offers a few wallpapers for you. In any case, please feel free to download these and use them on your desktop.

## Nintendo 3DS Skin
Use theme managers (Anemone, CHMM, Themely, ThemePack, etc. etc. etc.) to replace the skin. The skin was created with 3DS Theme Editor.

## Sound Scheme
Use this to replace system sounds or change it through the sound settings (e.g. in **Control Panel** in Windows, **System Setup** in OS/2 or **Preferences** in BeOS or Haiku, it is located under **Desktop Themes: Settings: Sound events** or **Sounds and Multimedia: Sounds: Sound Events** in Windows 95/98/ME, **Sounds** in Windows 2000, BeOS or Haiku, **Sounds and Audio Devices** in Windows XP (also in **Sounds, Speech, and Audio Devices** in category view), and under **Sound: Sounds: Program Events** (also in **Hardware and Sound** in category view or **Personalization** in icon view) in Windows Vista & above, OS/2 and more, **Sound and Audio Devices** on ReactOS, and **Settings: Personalization: Themes: Sounds** in Windows 10). The sound scheme was created with Windows Sound Recorder (Windows XP version) and Wavosaur.

Windows 95 until 7 allows the user to change the sounds used when logging off or on or shutting down the operating system (with Windows 8 & above, the `ExcludeFromCPL` value was added to `WindowsLogoff` and `WindowsLogon` sound events; remove this value to show these events).

## Windows OEM Branding
The zipped archive is included for use with Windows 95 until XP.

Since Windows Vista & above, the registry keys are located in HKLM on `OEMInformation` by adding the following keys:
* **Logo**: `OEMlogo.bmp`
* **Manufacturer**: Robert Matthew Pelloni

## Boot Skin
For use with the Windows XP version of [BootSkin](https://www.stardock.com/products/bootskin/) only. Available in English, German, Polish, Spanish and Turkish. Attempting to install this skin under the Windows Vista version will most likely result in an error message, so please don't try it. I created this with Windows Paint.

## Palm OS Emulator Skin
Use this to replace the Generic skin from the executable file (bmp) or simply access them from the Skins dialog (jpg). The skin is assigned to some Palm devices. The jpg files were created with [PMView](https://www.pmview.com/).

This skin can be used with the emulators listed below. Robert Pelloni is not the original author of these emulators.

### CoPilot/2

### Palm Hardware Emulator
Available as proprietary commercial software in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.perpendox.phem). Perpendox Software LLC hosted the source code under the same license in Palm OS Emulator but the company's website is dead.
