These textual icons are for use with OS/2 applications.

Note that you have to use these icons on a file system which supports long file names. FAT16 does not support long file names, while the existing FAT32 or even NTFS file system drivers for OS/2, eCS and Arca OS are experimental at best, so the safest bet is to use a native IBM file system like HPFS (the OS/2, eCS and Arca OS default FS) or JFS.

### ANNEX: How to add or update existing software entries.
To add or update existing software entries, attach the following text, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included on the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier identification within third-party archives.
