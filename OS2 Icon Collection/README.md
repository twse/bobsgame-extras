These textual icons are for use with OS/2 applications.

Note that you have to use these icons on a file system which supports long file names. FAT16 does not support long file names, while the existing FAT32 or even NTFS file system drivers for OS/2, eCS and Arca OS are experimental at best, so the safest bet is to use a native IBM file system like HPFS (the OS/2, eCS and Arca OS default FS) or JFS.
